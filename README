DOTFILES
========

About
-----

This is a personal dotfiles repo for my personal
use case.

Inspired from and shamlessly scripts taken from:
https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice

Initial Setup
-------------

Just copy the files from this repo to `$HOME/.config` directory,
or if feeling lazy just download `GNU stow` through the package manager
and do the stuff. Alternatively, this repo could be cloned directly to the
`$HOME/.config` directory.

Symlinks are made for xprofile and zprofile.
This assumes that zsh is the default shell,
if using `bash` then change the name to `.bash_profile`.

Programs
--------

The following program's config are available:
    dunst
    git
    lf (AUR terminal file browser)
    mpv
    neovim
    sxiv (image viewer)
    zathura (file viewer, especially for pdfs)
    zsh (the default shell)
    X11 (needless to say)
